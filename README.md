# PROJECT NAME: EASY

# OVERVIEW
# EASY is an app that is developed to provide services to ease up the workload of our fellow singaporeans after a long day's of work through servicesits such as online grocery shopping,online wallet system,food delivery as well as mobility

# SALES PITCH
# Make your day easier .With EASY


# DESIGN PROCESS/ GOAL
# While building up our project from scratch we never really had a targetted group of users/customers we were focusing on. Unlike other companies we wanted our project to appeal and be able to cater to as many people as possible , to make it easier for everyone to go through their day with the services we provide. So with that goal in mind, we brainstormed ideas of common hassles everyone seemed to have (in sg at least) and researched upon it. And after throrough research and user questioning we were able to narrow down what were the few main complains people had in general, these included food delivery,mobility,online grocery shopping.

# LIST OF HASSLES PEOPLE HAVE (USER STORIES)
# - no time to cook or get proper food after work/during covid encouraged not to go out
# - getting grocereies (especially after covid)
# - hard to flag down taxis especially when rushing
